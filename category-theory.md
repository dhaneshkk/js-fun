#Category Theory#
-Category theory is an abstract branch of mathematics that can formalize concepts from several different branches 
such as set theory, type theory, group theory, logic, and more. 
It primarily deals with objects, morphisms, and transformations, which mirrors programming quite closely.

-Category is defined as a collection with the following components:
  -A collection of objects
  -A collection of morphisms 
  -A notion of composition on the morphisms 
  -A distinguished morphism called identity 

-Category theory is abstract enough to model many things, Let us model our computer program.  
   Objects - Data Types
   morphisms - pure functions
   notion of composition on the morphisms - compose
  A distinguished morphism called identity Let's introduce a useful function called id . This function simply takes some input and spits it back at you
  var id = function(x){ return x; };
